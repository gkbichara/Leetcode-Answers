Created a dictionary of all keys and what their corresponding values are
Initialized a counter and a variable that stores the string's length
Used a while loop as it's easier to manipulate i compared to for loop

Check if i is at end of string
Initial approach was to individually check for I, V and X and check for subsequent values that are bigger
More optimized approach is to check if the next value is bigger than current, then subtract smaller from bigger and add
Skip both until end of string
