Store strings in an array
Create a pointer for each
Create a while loop to traverse both arrays at the same time
Initial approach was O(n^2), realized mistake and went back
Check for element in array of string s and see if element is in other array (string t)
If it is present, move along both pointers in the arrays
If not, keep traversing until you find it or reach end of array
If end of array is reached and passed, skip
