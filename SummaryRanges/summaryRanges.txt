My initial approach was somewhat correct, but had to ask for help on this one
First thing to do so is check if list is empty
Store first element as a temp variable
Then go through list once and compare if last element is equal to current
If it is not, check if temp variable is equal to the current last element
If it is, it means it has no values following it must be added alone
If it i-1 is not equal to temp, it means it has a sequence so add temp until i-1 in the list using the format
Set current to temp


Basically, the way to do it is advance in array and check i-1 constantly as it is easier than checking i with i+1
Check if i-1 and i are equal, if not do the steps above
No need to check for anything else if they are equal
