Create temporary variables to store future sums and values in
Use a while loop cause more intuitive to me (not necessarily best option)
Check if current item is smaller than current minimum
If it is then change it
Else
Calculate difference between current element and the minimum
If it is bigger than the current max, change it
Cannot just sort as order of days matters
