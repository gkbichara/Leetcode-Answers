Check if first string is empty, if it is return empty string
Set prefix to first letter
Go through array
If any string is empty, return empty string
Check for length of prefix and length of current string, use minimum as inner for loop to avoid index issues
Create a temp prefix to store prefix of current string with current prefix
Check if they are equal, if they are append current char to string
Do this until char in prefix and current string are different or the smaller one end
If it is different just end prefix at j
Temp is needed as sometimes they are the same until one ends, and then you wou;dn't end the string
So the prefix you return is too long
